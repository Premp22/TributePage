             <p>Martin Scorsese, original name Martin Marcantonio Luciano Scorsese, (born November 17, 1942, Queens, New York, U.S.), American filmmaker known for his harsh, often violent depictions of American culture. From the 1970s Scorsese created a body of work that was ambitious, bold, and brilliant. But even his most acclaimed films are demanding, sometimes unpleasantly intense dramas that have enjoyed relatively little commercial success.Thus, Scorsese bears the not totally undeserved reputation as a cult director who works with big budgets and Hollywoodâ€™s most desirable stars. In terms of artistry, he was perhaps the most significant American director of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>
